# Basic-C-sharp-projects

This repo includes more C# projects, but these are all console applications made for the purpose of testing C#.

Listed are some photos from a game of BlackJack I made in a console app.

As you can see from my other repositories, I am quite capable of using entity framework, but this was a good example of manually logging to the database instead.

Here's some more code from that project.

And this is what the console app looks like in action!
